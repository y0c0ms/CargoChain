# CargoChain — Public-Chain Logistics Platform

[![CI](https://github.com/y0c0ms/CargoChain/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/y0c0ms/CargoChain/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **Course:** Blockchain & DLT · **Institution:** ISCTE
> **Use Case:** 3 — Transportation (Shipping · Logistics · Airlines · Railways)

A prototype multi-modal cargo-tracking platform built on a **public EVM chain** (Ethereum Sepolia, with local Hardhat for development). Every consignment is deployed as its own on-chain contract via **EIP-1167 minimal proxies**; custody transfers are bilateral and recorded immutably; every IoT sensor batch is anchored as a **Merkle root** — individual readings can be verified by anyone without storing them on-chain.

---

## Academic Motivation

The architecture is grounded in a **PRISMA systematic review of 33 peer-reviewed papers (2017–2026)** on blockchain applied to transport and pharmaceutical traceability — a domain where the stakes of traceability failures are well-documented (the WHO estimates 10% of global medicines in circulation are counterfeit or sub-standard, generating an illicit market of US$200 billion annually). Three EU regulatory instruments define the compliance landscape: the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD, 2011/62/EU), the EMA GDP Guidelines (2013), and eIDAS 2.0 (Regulation 2024/1183) for portable cross-border digital identities.

The literature evolved in **five distinct waves**, each resolving the limitations of the previous:

| Period | Wave | Focus | Landmark Papers |
|--------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 2017–2018 | 1st — Proof of Concept | Viability; first gas cost measurements | Bocek (2017), Tian (2017) |
| 2019–2021 | 2nd — Complete Systems | End-to-end architectures; IoT + GDP/FMD | Musamih (2021), Uddin/MedLedger (2021) |
| 2022–2023 | 3rd — Efficiency & Regulation | EPCIS 2.0; hybrid off-chain; economic analysis | Li (2022), Gruchmann (2023) |
| 2024 | 4th — Identity & Governance | DIDs/VCs; selective disclosure; 24 governance requirements | Fernández-Iglesias (2024), Flamini (2024), Greiner (2024) |
| 2025–2026 | 5th — Integration & Failures | TradeLens lessons; IoT identity; 73% fail on governance | Najati (2025), Hanisch (2026), Ramírez-Gordillo (2025) |

**The pattern across all five waves is consistent:** each wave resolves the central problem of the previous but exposes a new problem the next wave must address.

### Why a public chain?

Every major permissioned-chain consortium — TradeLens (IBM + Maersk, >US$100M, 300+ orgs), we.trade, Marco Polo, Contour, B3i, ASX CHESS — failed in 2022–2023. Najati (2025) applies Ostrom's commons theory to TradeLens and identifies five structural failure factors. Hanisch et al. (2026) analyse 81 blockchain projects across 25 industries: **73% of failures are caused by governance, not technology.** CargoChain takes the opposite stance: Ethereum provides public auditability, regulatory verifiability, and neutral infrastructure that no single operator controls — directly addressing the primary failure mode of the prior decade.

The full analysis of 16 industry deployments is in [docs/CASE_STUDIES.md](docs/CASE_STUDIES.md).

## Design Decisions — Academic Provenance

Every architectural choice in CargoChain is traceable to peer-reviewed evidence from the SOTA review.

| Component | Decision | Academic Basis |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Package.sol** — bilateral custody | `transferCustody()` only moves ownership; `markDelivered()` is called by the receiver — two explicit on-chain acts | Musamih et al. (2021, ~324 citations): bilateral CustodyTransfer prevents liability disputes when cargo is damaged or missing |
| **PackageFactory.sol** — EIP-1167 clones | One contract address per shipment, spawned gas-efficiently (~45k gas/clone); factory validates clone authenticity | Address-level isolation replaces single-mapping registries; eliminates cross-shipment state pollution |
| **MerkleIoT.sol** — Merkle batching | N IoT readings → one 32-byte Merkle root on-chain; individual readings provable off-chain with O(log N) proofs | Fernández-Iglesias et al. (2024): **64–75% gas reduction** vs. on-chain storage; Bocek (2017) identified the cost problem in 2017 |
| **Hybrid off-chain storage** | `docsHash` + `docsURI` on-chain; cargo JSON off-chain (IPFS/HTTPS) | Li et al. (2022): EPCIS 2.0 as canonical off-chain model; 94% cost reduction; GDPR compliance by construction (personal data never immutably on-chain) |
| **Oracle allowlist** | `approvedOracle` mapping; only whitelisted addresses can call `anchorBatch()` | Sarkar (2023), Zeng (2024): unauthenticated sensors are the primary attack vector — anyone can inject false readings without access control |
| **State machine** | `Created → InTransit → Delivered / Disputed` in `Package.sol` | Musamih (2021): on-chain state machine for custody transfers; Haq & Muselemu Esuka (2018): GDP/FMD require verifiable handover records |
| **Platform choice** | Ethereum Sepolia (prototyping); roadmap to Hyperledger Fabric + Ethereum L1 anchors | Duman & Aydoğan (2025): Fabric 442–818 TPS, <2 s deterministic finality vs. Ethereum ~15 TPS; Musamih (2021): dual-layer reference model |

## Six Research Gaps — SOTA Position

The PRISMA review of 33 papers identifies six gaps that no existing paper resolves simultaneously. CargoChain's response to each:

| Gap | Absence in the Literature | CargoChain Response |
|-----|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **G1 — DIDs/VCs absent in traceability** | All 15 primary corpus papers use centralised identity (PKI / Fabric CA). Zero papers implement DIDs in cargo tracking. | *Future extension:* DID registry + carrier VC lifecycle (W3C DID Core 1.0 + VC Data Model 2.0) |
| **G2 — IoT scalability** | Bocek (2017): on-chain IoT storage prohibitively expensive. Coldnet (2025): ~$0.15/batch in Ethereum L1. | `MerkleIoT.sol`: Merkle batching — 64–75% gas reduction (Fernández-Iglesias, 2024). IOTA zero-fee as future extension. |
| **G3 — Neutral governance** | TradeLens (>US$100M) shut down 2022. 73% of blockchain projects fail on governance (Hanisch, 2026). | PharmaLedger governance model (neutral operator); satisfies 5/24 Greiner technical requirements; 19 organisational requirements are explicit future work |
| **G4 — GDP/FMD/eIDAS alignment** | Haq (2018): GDP+FMD but no IoT. Fernández-Iglesias (2024): GDP+IoT but no DIDs. No paper combines all three. | `Package.sol` covers GDP custody trail. VC layer for eIDAS 2.0 is planned as a future extension. |
| **G5 — EPCIS 2.0 canonical model** | Li (2022): EPCIS 2.0 + Fabric but no DIDs. No paper combines EPCIS 2.0 + DIDs + Merkle IoT. | `docsURI` points to EPCIS 2.0-compatible JSON; SHA-256 `docsHash` anchored on-chain |
| **G6 — VC revocation in IoT** | None of the 33 papers implements VC revocation for IoT devices. EVOKE (Mazzocca, 2024) demonstrates the solution but not in a transport context. | Identified as highest-priority future extension (ECC accumulator-based revocation) |

| VCs for professional licences (GDP/FMD) | TRL 4–5 | Laboratory validation | No published pharma production case |
| DIDs for IoT devices | TRL 3–4 | Proof of concept | Ramírez-Gordillo (2025): IOTA + Raspberry Pi 4; ~175% CPU during crypto ops |
| Selective disclosure — BBS signatures | TRL 4–5 | Formal technical validation | Flamini et al. (2024, ACM CCS): unlinkability formally proved |
| VC revocation in IoT (EVOKE) | TRL 3–4 | Proof of concept | Mazzocca (2024, USENIX Security): 12.62–499.70 ms on consumer devices |
| Multi-stakeholder consortium governance | TRL 6–7 | PharmaLedger in operation | 18 members, neutrality demonstrated; Hanisch (2026): 81 cases analysed |

## Future Roadmap

Prioritisation: security criticality → documented technical viability → industrial adoption impact.

| Extension | Horizon | Priority | Literature Basis |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **EVOKE VC revocation for IoT** | 6–12 months | **Critical** | Mazzocca et al. (2024, USENIX Security): 12.62–499.70 ms, ~1.5 KB/device, 3× more efficient than StatusList2021 |
| **DIDs/VCs for carriers** | 12–18 months | High | Flamini et al. (2024, ACM CCS): BBS > SD-JWT for multi-verifier unlinkability; Bećirović Ramić et al. (2024): comparative taxonomy |
| **DIDs for IoT devices** | 12–24 months | High | Ramírez-Gordillo et al. (2025): IOTA + Raspberry Pi 4, zero transaction fees |
| **Full EPCIS 2.0 off-chain** | 6–18 months | Medium | Li et al. (2022): canonical GS1 model; Greiner (2024): open standard as core governance requirement |
| **eIDAS 2.0 / EUDIW integration** | 18–36 months | High | Regulation 2024/1183; EBSI in EU production |
| **Migration to Hyperledger Fabric** | 18–36 months | Medium | Duman & Aydoğan (2025): 442–818 TPS, <2 s deterministic finality; Musamih (2021): dual-layer reference architecture |

The highest-priority immediate extension is EVOKE revocation: absent revocation is an operational security vulnerability. If a sensor is compromised or a carrier loses its GDP licence mid-transport, there is no mechanism to invalidate its credentials in real time. EVOKE (USENIX Security 2024) demonstrates sub-second revocation on consumer hardware — the reference implementation exists; the missing piece is integration with cargo traceability.
